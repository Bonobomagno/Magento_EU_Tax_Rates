Magento_EU_Tax_Rates
====================

Starting from 1st of January 2015, EU tax regulation changes. Instead of the original tax calculation,
where the seller took the tax rate from his own country, the tax now needs to be based on the country of
the seller. Within Magento, this simply means that the tax is calculated using tax rates that differ per EU
country.

This repository contains a file `tax_rates.csv` which can be imported into the Magento System Configuration 
to setup tax rates automatically.
